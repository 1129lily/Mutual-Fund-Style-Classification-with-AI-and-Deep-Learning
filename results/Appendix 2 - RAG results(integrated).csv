Principal Investment Strategies

The fund will generally invest in larger-sized companies using a quantitative model that combines fundamental measures of a stock’s value and growth potential. To measure value, the managers may use ratios of stock price-to-earnings and stock price-to-cash flow, among others. To measure growth, the managers may use the rate of growth of a company’s earnings and cash flow and changes in its earnings estimates, as well as other factors. The model also considers price momentum. The portfolio managers also take environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") factors into account in making investment decisions.  The portfolio managers attempt to build a portfolio of stocks that provides better returns than, and a dividend yield comparable to, the S&P 500® Index, without taking on significant additional risk.

Others: Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

The emerging European investable universe, due to its limited geographic scope and less developed markets, tends to rely heavily on the success of certain industries and sectors. As a result, the fund may invest up to 35% of its net assets in any industry that accounts for more than 20% of the emerging European market as a whole, as measured by an index determined by T. Rowe Price to be an appropriate measure of the emerging European market (currently MSCI Emerging Markets Europe Index).

Principal Investment Strategies

The fund invests in California municipal and other debt securities with an emphasis on high-yield securities. A high-yield security is one that has been rated below investment-grade, or determined by the investment advisor to be of similar quality. Under normal market conditions, the portfolio managers invest at least 80% of the fund’s net assets in municipal securities with income payments exempt from federal and California income taxes. Cities, counties and other municipalities in California and U.S. territories usually issue these securities for public projects, such as schools, roads, and water and sewer systems. Some of these investments are not necessarily exempt from the federal alternative minimum tax.",{'source': 'NLP_app\\MutualFundSummary\\CALIFORNIA HIGH-YIELD MUNICIPAL FUND.txt'},2.0

The returns in the bar chart are for Class A shares and do not reflect a sales charge. If the sales charge was reflected, the returns would be lower. Past performance (both before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. The Fund’s performance reflects the effects of expense reductions. Absent these reductions, performance would have been lower.

Issuers in the utilities industry include issuers engaged in the manufacture, production, generation, transmission, sale or distribution of electric, gas or other types of energy, water or other sanitary services; and issuers engaged in telecommunications, including telephone, cellular telephone, satellite, microwave, cable television, and other communications media (but not engaged in public broadcasting).",{'source': 'NLP_app\\MutualFundSummary\\MFS Utilities Fund.txt'},1.0
